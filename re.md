Hereâ€™s a summary of the plan update:

Added notes about the resolved import/export naming issue between 
courseRoute.js
 and 
courseController.js

Added a checklist for fixing the route/controller import, confirming server startup, and next steps for monitoring Redis and RabbitMQ on CentOS.
Set the current goal to "Guide Redis/RabbitMQ monitoring on CentOS".
Now updating the plan file accordingly.

Completed
